# rust-lifx

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/rust-homeautomation/rust-lifx.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/rust-homeautomation/rust-lifx)

## Description

`rust-lifx` provides a simple implementation of a client that can talk to any
number of lifx bulbs, and provides an implementation of the payload, header, 
messages, and serialization procedures described in the LAN protocol on the 
LiFX developer webpage.

Currently, the implementation targets `V2.0` of the LAN protocol.

### Setup

Setup is done using `cargo`. Just run:

```
  cargo build
```

There are a number of examples you can run to test things out. To see some info
about bulbs configured on your network, you can run:

```
  cargo run  --example lifx_get_service
```


### Configure the logger to print while running examples

To configure the logger to print out useful information while running the examples
run:

```
  export RUST_LOG=device.in=info,device.out=info
```

For more detailed control, you can set the logging level for the following 
loggers:

  * device.in - all messages from any device that the client can intercept 
  * device.out - all output messages from the client
